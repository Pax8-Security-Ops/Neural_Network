# Security Operations Neural Network
---
## Introduction
---
The contents of this repository will include all available notes and documentation concerning the project to build a neural network for Security Operations. The main source of knowledge contributory to this project belong to another Github repository built to preserve material for a class about Machine Learning. Upon request, this information will be made available to whom it may concern for verification of info or expansion of certain topics. 

---
## Objective
---
Devise a method to extract continuous logs from the Sumo Logic application and train a neural network to recognize indications of traffic or activity normal to standard company operations or potential disruptions or threats which must be addressed accordingly by the SecOps team.
