## Introduction 

There are two different paths to take when creating a neural net intended for our purposes. However, I think the ideal final product should include elements from both. 

### 1) The Bootstrapping Method: A portion of the CSV image split off from the main data frame and retasked to form a series of sets that would 

Problem: In order for this method to work, the data that will be used to train the neural net must be seperated into two categories using Binary Classification. The first time I utilized this method, the dataset we used had a column labeled 'dataset', comprising two numbers. In our case, these numbers would be used to seperate normal network traffic and bad traffic. Unfortunately, I don't know how the dataset I used before back in class was given the 'dataset' column or even where the data set came from. My instructor provided it to the class and I can't remember his source. Furthermore, I don't know how to replicate that same column and it's mechanics in the form of a search query for Sumo Logic. 

### 2) Recurrent Neural Network:
